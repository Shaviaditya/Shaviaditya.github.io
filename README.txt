This is a task that I was assigned by GLUG NITDGP on working with cookies to create a CTF Question based on it.
You can visit the site using the URL:
https://shaviaditya.github.io/
I have made the project using VSCode Editor and using liveserver to host it to work with it.
It has the following files:
index.html
main.js
sol.html
Link.txt
style.css
The index.html is the parent file that controls all the other files to launch the Question on a local host using liveserver.
Have fun working on solving the question.
Since I'm a beginner and is my first attempt at making even a Level1 Question on CTF please consider my efforts.
Thanks, Rudraditya
May the source be with you :)
